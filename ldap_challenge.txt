I connected to the Duke network as an anonymous user using jxplorer.
If I am interpreting the directions correctly it appears that the text below is an
example of some of the information I can view as an anonymous user.

It looks like basic info such as username, status at duke (in this case a professor)
a contact email and what appears to be a work address. Also several ids relevent to
the DB can be seen
